### 3. **Functionality**

#### **Handler Functions**
All admin actions are implemented with state management:

```typescript
// Investment Management
handleApproveInvestment(id) // Approves investment and updates state
handleRejectInvestment(id)  // Rejects investment and updates state

// Withdrawal Management
handleApproveWithdrawal(id) // Approves withdrawal and updates state
handleRejectWithdrawal(id)  // Rejects withdrawal and updates state

// KYC Management
handleApproveKyc(id)        // Approves KYC and updates state
handleRejectKyc(id)         // Rejects KYC and updates state

// User Management
handleViewUser(user)        // Opens user detail modal
handleUpdateUserBalance()   // Updates user balance (future enhancement)
handleLogout()              // Logs out admin and returns to login
```

#### **Data Integration**
- Fetches data from Supabase database:
  - `getAllUsers()` - All registered users
  - `getAllInvestments()` - All investment records
  - `getAllWithdrawals()` - All withdrawal requests
- Includes fallback mock data for testing without database
- Real-time statistics calculations

### 4. **Access Control**

#### **Admin Authentication**
The dashboard checks for admin privileges on load:
```typescript
// Checks localStorage/sessionStorage for:
// 1. adminData object (legacy)
// 2. activeUser with admin: true property
```

If user is not admin, they are redirected to `/login`.

#### **Admin Menu Integration**
A special "Admin Panel" button appears in the user dashboard sidebar **only** for admin users:
- Located below the Support menu item
- Styled with purple gradient border for distinction
- Navigates to `/dashboard/admin`
- Uses conditional rendering: `{currentUser?.admin && ...}`

5. **Run these commands**:
   ```javascript
   const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('activeUser'));
   user.admin = true;
   localStorage.setItem('activeUser', JSON.stringify(user));
   location.reload();
   ```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### File Structure
```
src/pages/dashboard/
├── AdminDashboard.tsx    // Main admin dashboard (1000+ lines)
├── UserDashboard.tsx     // User dashboard with admin menu link
└── ...

src/styles/
└── dashboard.css         // Shared dashboard styles
```

### State Management
```typescript
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<'overview' | 'users' | 'investments' | 'withdrawals' | 'kyc'>('overview')
const [allUsers, setAllUsers] = useState<any[]>([])
const [allInvestments, setAllInvestments] = useState<any[]>([])
const [allWithdrawals, setAllWithdrawals] = useState<any[]>([])
const [allKycRequests, setAllKycRequests] = useState<any[]>([])
const [selectedUser, setSelectedUser] = useState<any>(null)
const [showUserModal, setShowUserModal] = useState(false)
const [showSidePanel, setShowSidePanel] = useState(false)
```

### Routing
- **Admin Route**: `/dashboard/admin`
- **Protected**: Requires `admin: true` in user object
- **Redirect**: Non-admin users sent to `/login`

### Database Integration
```typescript
// Supabase function calls
const users = await supabaseDb.getAllUsers()
const investments = await supabaseDb.getAllInvestments()
const withdrawals = await supabaseDb.getAllWithdrawals()

// Mock data fallback (for testing without DB)
setAllUsers([{ id: 1, name: 'John Doe', ... }])
setAllInvestments([{ id: 1, plan: 'Starter', ... }])
setAllWithdrawals([{ id: 1, amount: 500, ... }])
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Admin Panel" button not showing
**Solution**: Verify user has `admin: true` property
```javascript
// Check in DevTools Console:
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('activeUser')))
// Should see: { ... admin: true, ... }
```

### Issue: Redirected to login when accessing `/dashboard/admin`
**Solution**: Ensure admin authentication is set
```javascript
// Set admin flag:
const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('activeUser'));
user.admin = true;
localStorage.setItem('activeUser', JSON.stringify(user));
```

### Issue: Data not loading
**Solution**: Check Supabase connection or use mock data
```typescript
// Mock data is automatically loaded if Supabase fails
// Check browser console for error messages
```

### Issue: Approve/Reject buttons not working
**Solution**: Verify handler functions are called
```javascript
// Each button has onClick event:
onClick={() => handleApproveInvestment(inv.id)}
// Check browser console for alerts
```

## 📊 Statistics Calculations

All statistics are calculated in real-time from state:

```typescript
// User Statistics
const totalUsers = allUsers.length

// Investment Statistics
const totalInvestments = allInvestments.reduce((sum, inv) => sum + (inv.capital || 0), 0)
const pendingInvestments = allInvestments.filter(inv => inv.status === 'Pending').length

// Withdrawal Statistics
const totalWithdrawals = allWithdrawals.reduce((sum, w) => sum + (w.amount || 0), 0)
const pendingWithdrawals = allWithdrawals.filter(w => w.status === 'Pending').length

// KYC Statistics
const pendingKyc = allKycRequests.filter(k => k.status === 'Pending').length
```

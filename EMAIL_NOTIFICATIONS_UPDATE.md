# Email Notification Updates - January 2026

## Overview
Updated loan and investment email notifications to use professional HTML styling matching other system emails (deposits, withdrawals, KYC). Added daily ROI information to investment notifications.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Loan Notifications Styling** ✅
- **Updated:** `src/utils/emailService.ts` - `sendLoanNotification()` function
- **Changes:**
  - Replaced simple text notifications with professional HTML templates
  - Added styled email layout matching other notifications (blue header, gold accents)
  - Includes eToro Trust Capital logo
  - Added color-coded status indicators:
    - 🟢 Approved: Green status
    - 🔴 Rejected: Red status  
    - 🟡 Pending: Orange status
  - Added detailed information table showing:
    - Amount Requested/Approved
    - Duration (months)
    - Status with color coding
  - Added call-to-action buttons linking to dashboard/support
  
### 2. **Investment Notifications Enhancement** ✅
- **Updated:** `src/utils/emailService.ts` - `sendInvestmentNotification()` function
- **Changes:**
  - Added professional HTML styling matching loan notifications
  - **NEW:** Added daily ROI information including:
    - Daily ROI Rate (percentage)
    - Daily ROI Expected (dollar amount calculated from capital × rate)
    - Duration (days)
    - Total Return Expected (daily ROI × duration)
  - Function signature updated to accept `dailyRoiRate` and `durationDays` parameters
  - Shows all investment details in styled table format
  
### 3. **Dashboard Integration** ✅
- **Updated:** `src/pages/dashboard/UserDashboard.tsx`
  - Modified investment creation to pass `selectedPlan.dailyRate` and `selectedPlan.durationDays` to email notification
  
- **Updated:** `src/pages/dashboard/AdminDashboard.tsx`
  - Added `getPlanByName` import from plan config
  - Modified investment approval/rejection handlers to fetch plan config and pass daily rate and duration to notifications

### 4. **Email Service Infrastructure** ✅
- **Updated:** `EmailNotification` interface in `src/utils/emailService.ts`
  - Made `message` field optional
  - Added `html` field for raw HTML support
  - Allows notifications to use either generated HTML (from message) or custom HTML templates
  
- **Updated:** `sendEmailNotification()` function
  - Now supports both message-based emails (auto-wrapped with template) and custom HTML
  - Validates that either message or HTML is provided
  - Passes custom HTML directly to API without additional wrapping

### 5. **Backend Logging** ✅
- **Updated:** Both `api/index.js` and `server/index.js`
  - Added comprehensive logging to `/api/send-email` endpoint:
    - Logs incoming requests with recipient and subject
    - Logs Mailjet send status and message IDs
    - Captures detailed error information (status codes, error messages)
  - Matches logging standards of other notification endpoints

### 6. **URL Resolution Fix** ✅
- **Updated:** `src/lib/supabaseUtils.ts` - `notifyBackend()` function
  - Fixed trailing slash issue in `VITE_APP_URL`
  - Strips trailing slashes before concatenating endpoints
  - Prevents double slashes in API URLs (e.g., `//api/send-email`)

## Email Template Design

All notifications now follow this consistent structure:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  HEADER (Dark Blue #0f172a)    │
│  - eToro Trust Capital Logo            │
│  - Gold accent color #f0b90b    │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  CONTENT (White background)     │
│  - Greeting                      │
│  - Main message                  │
│  - Information table with:       │
│    • Bold labels (left)          │
│    • Gold highlights (values)    │
│  - Call-to-action button         │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  FOOTER (Light gray)             │
│  - Copyright notice              │
│  - "Do not reply" message        │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Investment Notification Example

When a user creates an investment in the "12-Day Plan" with $5,000:

**Email shows:**
- Plan: 12-Day Plan
- Capital Invested: **$5,000**
- Daily ROI Rate: 3.00%
- **Daily ROI Expected: $150.00** ← NEW
- Duration: 12 Days
- **Total Return Expected: $1,800.00** ← NEW

This gives users clear visibility into their expected daily earnings and total returns before the investment is activated.

## Loan Notification Example

When admin approves a $10,000 loan for 12 months:

**Email shows:**
- Amount Approved: **$10,000**
- Duration: 12 months
- Status: **Approved** (green color)
- Call-to-action: "View Dashboard" button

## Testing

Created test scripts to verify functionality:
- `scripts/test-loan-notification.js` - Tests loan notification endpoint
- `scripts/test-styled-notifications.js` - Tests both loan and investment styled emails

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Loan notifications send successfully with professional styling
- ✅ Investment notifications include daily ROI calculations
- ✅ Emails match design of other system notifications
- ✅ All endpoints return successful message IDs from Mailjet

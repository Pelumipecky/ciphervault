## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase Database

**📘 For detailed database setup instructions, see [DATABASE_SETUP.md](./DATABASE_SETUP.md)**

Quick steps:
1. Create a Supabase project at [https://app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Run the SQL schema from `supabase-schema.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
3. Get your project URL and anon key from Settings > API
4. Update `.env` file with your credentials (see below)

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

The `.env` file is already configured with a Supabase project. To use your own:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Never commit real credentials to version control!

### 4. Run Development Server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in terminal)

### 5. Create Your First Account

1. Navigate to `/signup`
2. Fill in the registration form
3. Your account will be created in Supabase!
4. Login at `/login` with your credentials

### 6. Access Admin Dashboard (Optional)

To enable admin features for your account:

**Option 1 - Quick Testing (Browser Console):**
```javascript
// After logging in as a regular user:
// 1. Open DevTools (F12)
// 2. Go to Console tab
// 3. Run these commands:
const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('activeUser'));
user.admin = true;
localStorage.setItem('activeUser', JSON.stringify(user));
location.reload();
```

**Option 2 - Database Level (Recommended for Production):**
1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to Table Editor → `users` table
3. Add a column named `admin` with type `boolean` (if not exists)
4. Find your user record
5. Set `admin = true` for that user
6. User will see "Admin Panel" link after next login

**Option 3 - During Development:**
- In the signup flow, you can manually add `admin: true` to the user object before saving

Once admin access is enabled:
- An "Admin Panel" button appears in the user dashboard sidebar
- Navigate to `/dashboard/admin` to access the admin dashboard
- Manage users, approve investments/withdrawals, and review KYC requests

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

This is a Single Page Application (SPA) with client-side routing. The 404 error occurs because deployment servers don't know how to handle routes like `/dashboard` or `/admin` that don't correspond to actual files.

### ✅ Automatic Configuration Added

The following deployment configuration has been added to fix 404 errors:

- **`vercel.json`** - For Vercel deployments (automatically handles SPA routing)

### 🚀 Deploy to Vercel

#### Option 1: Vercel CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Follow the prompts to connect your GitHub repo
```

#### Option 2: Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will automatically detect `vercel.json` and configure routing
5. Deploy - all routes will work correctly!

#### Option 3: GitHub Integration
1. Push your code to GitHub (already done!)
2. Connect Vercel to your GitHub account
3. Import the `ciphervault` repository
4. Deploy automatically

### 🔧 Build Commands

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

### ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

**404 on Direct Links:**
- ✅ **FIXED** - `vercel.json` handles all SPA routes
- Routes like `/dashboard`, `/admin`, `/login` now work

**Environment Variables:**
- Set these in Vercel dashboard under Project Settings > Environment Variables:
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

**Build Errors:**
- Run `npm run build` locally first to catch issues
- Check TypeScript errors with `npx tsc --noEmit`

**Database Connection:**

```

## Optional Express + Supabase Backend

The Express app under `server/` handles contact submissions and other secure workflows using the Supabase service-role key.

```powershell
cd server
copy .env.example .env
# populate SUPABASE_URL + SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Endpoints: `/api/health`, `/api/contact`, `/api/signup`, `/api/login`.
- Run the SQL in `sql/schema.sql` to create the required tables (for example `public.contacts`).
- Rotate the service-role key immediately if it leaks.

## Theme & Routing Notes

- Navbar links cover both SPA sections (`/#packages`, `/#faq`, `/#contact`) and legacy detail pages when needed.
- `ThemeProvider` stores the palette under `ciphervault-theme` in `localStorage`; delete that key to reset to system defaults.
- Legacy HTML pages still reference `supabase-config.js`; update those placeholders if you plan to serve them.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing env vars** – the app logs warnings if Supabase values are absent, but API calls will fail. Double-check `.env` before running `npm run dev`.
- **Type errors** – run `npm run typecheck` (or `tsc --noEmit`) for detailed diagnostics when builds break.
- **Server issues** – install dependencies inside `/server` separately and ensure Node 18+.

## Legacy HTML Pages

Files such as `about.html`, `packages.html`, and `values.html` remain in the repo for historical reference. They are no longer bundled by Vite but can guide future React ports.

Happy shipping! :rocket:
- Endpoints: `/api/health`, `/api/contact`, `/api/signup`, `/api/login`.
- Run the SQL in `sql/schema.sql` to provision the required tables (`public.contacts`, etc.).
- Keep the service role key secret and rotate if compromised.

## Theme & Routing Notes

- Navbar covers both SPA sections (`/#packages`, `/#faq`, `/#contact`) and legacy detail pages where still needed.
- `ThemeProvider` stores preference under `ciphervault-theme`. Remove that key to reset to system defaults.
- Legacy static pages still reference `supabase-config.js`; update those placeholders if you plan to deploy them.

## Troubleshooting

- Missing Vite env vars trigger console warnings but Supabase calls will fail. Double-check `.env` before running `npm run dev`.
- If TypeScript errors stop the build, run `npm run typecheck` (or `tsc --noEmit`) for detailed diagnostics.
- When using the optional server, ensure Node.js ≥ 18 and install dependencies inside `/server` separately from the frontend.

Happy shipping! :rocket:

## Optional: Run a small Node backend that uses Supabase (server-side)

This project includes a simple Express server in `server/` that uses your Supabase service_role key for safe server-only operations (create users, insert contact messages, etc.). Use this when you want server-side validation, webhooks, or to avoid placing secret keys in the browser.

Quick steps (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd server
copy .env.example .env
# Edit .env and paste your SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
npm install
npm run dev

# In a separate terminal (project root) start a dev static server for the frontend:
cd ..
python -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Notes:
- The server exposes these endpoints: `/api/health`, `/api/contact`, `/api/signup` and `/api/login`.
- Make sure you run the SQL in `sql/schema.sql` to create all necessary tables (including the new `public.contacts` table).
- Never commit your Supabase service_role key — keep it in environment variables and rotate it if it leaks.

            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>
              Cypher Vault was founded by financial analysts, cybersecurity engineers, and blockchain strategists who saw 
              the same problem in crypto: investing driven by hype, and fragile security that harmed investors' trust. 
              The firm's origin traces to 2020 after a founder lost assets in a platform breach. That experience led to 
              a mission: build an investment model where every asset is secured and verified — like storing value in a 
              vault — and invest with intelligence and discipline.
